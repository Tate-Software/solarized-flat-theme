## Design

Solarized Flat is elegant.
It persues the minimalist design --- without being over-simplified.

It should look great. And it will disturb or distract you the least.

It doesn`t provide many unnecessary icons. So this will help you when you are actually typing or thinking for the next. Instead of making you have to look around to pretend that you enjoy the theme, the improved minimalist & distraction-free experience will help you enjoy focusing on what you do, rather than anything else.

## Installation

Solarized Flat theme is designed to work with the latest development builds of Sublime Text, including [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/dev) and [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev).

### Using Sublime Package Control

If you are using Will Bond's excellent [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), you can easily install Solarized Flat Theme via the `Package Control: Install Package` menu item. The Flat Theme package is listed as `Theme - Solarized Flat` in the packages list.
